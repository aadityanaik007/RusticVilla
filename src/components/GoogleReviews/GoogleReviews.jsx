The attic (mezzanine floor) brought back childhood memories of a cozy treehouse, filled with soft toys and warmth. The above-ground plunge pool was clean and relaxing - just what we needed. Everything, from the lamps to the shower and AC, worked flawlessly. Thoughtful little details throughout the house added extra comfort. The food was delicious and homely. The caretaker was like a genie - warm, caring and always available at the beck of a call. A perfect monsoon getaway for peace, nature, and quiet moments. Truly a must-visit!",
